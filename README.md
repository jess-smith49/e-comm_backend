# e-comm_backend

## Description
This is a backend e-commerce application. Models and associations were created to allow users to use the PUT GET DELETE and POST methods. With this application, the user connects to a database and seeds it, and then starts the server. Using GET, it will return all products, categories, or tags. GET will also return a product, cateogory or tag by its ID. This application also allows for a user to update, create and delete a product, category or ID.

## Technologies
This backend focused application uses sequelize, node.js, dotenv, javascript, express, and MYSQL2. The IDE uses is VSCode. Insomnia Core was used for testing routes and data return.

## Future Development
The next step for further development would be to create the front-end of the application so that a user can search through products/tags/categories for specific items. This would be done using HTML and CSS or another type of design framework.
